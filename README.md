# BlackJack-OGL

Been reading through https://learnopengl.com/ and made this as practice for everything useful I've learned so far. Initially tried to get a texture array working, but ended up giving up and making my own template for spritesheet rendering for the cards. Learned basic lighting and text rendering while working on this, as well as C++ which I wasn't too familiar with. Most problems just ended up being linking or header issues caused by C++ and not OGL though.
